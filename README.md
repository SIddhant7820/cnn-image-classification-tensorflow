# Image Classification using CNN (TensorFlow)

This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build and train a basic deep learning model for image classification using a simple CNN architecture.

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

The CNN model consists of:
- Convolution layer for feature extraction
- Max pooling layer for dimensionality reduction
- Fully connected (Dense) layers for classification

This project focuses on simplicity and clarity rather than high accuracy.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**
- 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels)
- 10 different classes
- Dataset is automatically loaded using TensorFlow
